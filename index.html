                        <h2>1. Research Your Destination To Find The Best Photo Opportunities</h2>
                        <p>
                            Before your trip, I recommend researching the destination to find the most interesting photo opportunities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I always research the location I’m traveling to. I do this extensively and obsessively!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s up to you how much research you do. But you should definitely spend a bit of time looking up some great places to take pictures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, what kind of research can you do?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, you could search for photos that other people have taken at the locations you’re planning to visit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Search on Instagram or Google to get an idea of the kinds of photos people take there.
                        </p>

                        <h2>2. Capture Your Journey To Tell The Complete Story Of Your Travels</h2>
                        <p>
                            Travel photography isn’t just about photographing the destination.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For a more complete photographic story, capture your journey to and from the location you’re visiting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you’re traveling by plane, try to get a window seat where you have a view of the wing or propeller.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And of course, you could capture a beautiful aerial view of clouds, mountains, or city lights as you’re flying above.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your journey will often involve several different types of transport. And they all offer great photo opportunities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether you’re traveling by car, taxi, bus, train, boat, or plane, try to capture some interesting photos.
                        </p>
